        <!-- OUR MISSION -->

            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>
                We want you to get your dream job. Good interviews are not about memorizing scripts –
                they are about practicing the right stories and going deeper on the moments that show
                how you think, learn, and work with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                NextStep.AI takes care of the structure: we choose what to practice, highlight what stands
                out, and point to what needs work. Your part is simple – show up, answer honestly, and learn.

                    <h3>Super tailored reports for real interviews</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you get an interview with a specific company, share the job description.
                        We build a focused prep plan with targeted questions, key themes to review, and
                        talking points tuned to that position and team.

                    <h3>Deep analysis of your answers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our model reads your answers, finds what you did well and what you missed, and
                        turns that into clear strengths and improvement suggestions. No fluff – specific,
                        practical feedback you can use on your next attempt.

                        If you don’t have an interview yet, this is the best time to start. We have many
                        behavioral questions that work for almost any role, so you can build your stories
                        and feel ready when the opportunity appears.
